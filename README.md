One True Awk
============

This repo serves as an archive of all the versions of Brian
Kernighan's original Awk, and the subsequent development thereof.

The `versions/` directory has each version in a separate subdirectory.
The `latest/` directory has a full (as can be made) git history of all
the versions, with tip-of-tree being the latest version.

If you have access to a version of the code not represented
in this repo, then please send mail to me at <danfuzz@milk.com>,
or just submit a pull request!

Cheers,

-dan
