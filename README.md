One True Awk
============

This repo serves as an archive of versions of Awk developed
by the original Awk authors and most recently primarily maintained
by Brian Kernighan. This includes the earliest published version
through to the present day (as of this writing).

The `versions/` directory has each version in a separate subdirectory.
The `latest/` directory has a full (as can be made) git history of all
the versions, with tip-of-tree being the latest version. `git blame`
will provide useful output on files in `latest/`.

If you have access to a version of the code not represented in this
repo, then please send mail to me, or just submit a pull request.

Cheers!
