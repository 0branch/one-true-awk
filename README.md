One True Awk
============

This repo serves as an archive of versions of Awk developed
by the original Awk authors and most recently primarily maintained
by Brian Kernighan. This includes the earliest published version
through to the present day (as of this writing).

The [versions/](versions) directory has each version in a separate
subdirectory. See that directory's [README](versions/README.md) file
for details about the origin of each version.

The [latest/](latest) directory has a full (as can be
made) git history of all the versions, with tip-of-tree being the
latest version. `git blame` provides useful output on files in
`latest/`.

If you have access to a version of the code not represented in this
repo, then please send mail to me, or just submit a pull request.
In particular, the history contained herein is missing any versions
published in the years 1981&ndash;1997, and in addition
none of 1999, 2001, 2006, nor 2008 are represented.

Cheers!
